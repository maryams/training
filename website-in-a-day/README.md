## Introduction

To begin with, and while our projects are relatively lo-tech, we will develop on a system called JSBin. JSBin is a website that makes websites: it allows you to write html, css, and javascript on an online environment that automatically combines the three and instantly updates the result. JSBin hosts all of your work with a unique URL meaning you can come back to a project anytime from any machine. 

- <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">Get a GitHub account</a> - We'll come back to this later, it's good to connect this to JSBin early. 
- Open <a href="http://jsbin.com/locamo/latest">this reference page</a> and click through to your development environment.
- Set up a JSBin account using your GitHub details and take ownership of the bin!

## Step 1
### *HTML*

HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. It is the bare-bones framework that describes the flow of every document you will find on a website. 

HTML is a descriptive and instructive language which defines what things you want to go where on your website. It doesn't care about white-space or indentation or line-breaks and it should *never* (except for some very rare circumstances) contain logic or styling.

## Step 2
### *CSS*

CSS is cascading style sheets. It comes in this form:

```
selector {
    property: value;
    another-property: value;
}
```
The C in CSS reflects the importance of ordering your style declarations correctly. A parent element's styles will cascade down to a child's styles, and a declaration using a selector at the start of the document will be overwritten by a declaration on the same selector at the bottom.
