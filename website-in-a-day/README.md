## Step 1
### *HMTL*

HTML is the language of the website. It is the bare-bones framework that describes the flow of every document you will find on a website. 

HTML is a descriptive and instructive language which defines what things you want to go where on your website. It doesn't care about white-space or indentation or line-breaks and it should *never* (except for some very rare circumstances) contain logic or styling.

## Step 2
