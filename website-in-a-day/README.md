## Introduction

To begin with, and while our projects are relatively lo-tech, we will develop on a system called JSBin. JSBin is a website that makes websites: it allows you to write html, css, and javascript on an online environment that automatically combines the three and instantly updates the result. JSBin hosts all of your work with a unique URL meaning you can come back to a project anytime from any machine. 

## Step 1
### *HMTL*

HTML is the language of the website. It is the bare-bones framework that describes the flow of every document you will find on a website. 

HTML is a descriptive and instructive language which defines what things you want to go where on your website. It doesn't care about white-space or indentation or line-breaks and it should *never* (except for some very rare circumstances) contain logic or styling.
