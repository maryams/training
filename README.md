# Founders and Coders Training

This will be a starting point for everyone interested in running a training workshop. 

All resources used in training exercises must be accompanied with a detailed README and instructions for use. 

When delivering training consider:
- Not everything can be written for reference. Be over-prepared.
    - Let the README for each specific training project be written as losely as possible. 
- Teach best practice from the very beginning. (To this end - know best practice).
