## Introduction

It's a great thing you've learnt about HMTL and CSS and some principles of responsive design. Unfortunately, a lot of the skills you've got at your fingertips will need to be used quite differently when designing for email. 

Previously we learned about ensuring the separation of concerns: layout, style, logic etc. Now, we've got to blur the lines a little. What's more, we've got to back to some web design principles that were roundly ditched many years ago. 

## Step 1
### HTML 

## Step 2
### *CSS*

- Keep it to a max-width of 600px
- Images
    - Be sparing: clients block images by default
    - Always have a back up for background image which might not be supported
- Web fonts only
- Design Mobile-first!
    - Try to stick to a single column layout - be clear and concise

#### What's Supported?
